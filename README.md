# Real-Platformer
The true project

So, I didn't have the file I turned in saved as-is, and it was the one I edited when I met with you during office hours. So, to the best of my memory, the version I turned in had level one playable, and the character froze at the first frame of level two. And there were no bullets or wings in the level.
Sorry for all the trouble! And thanks again for letting me turn it in again
