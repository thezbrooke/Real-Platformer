I'm sorry it's not better.
I wanted to make something really interesting and fun. But I couldn't. I worked as hard as I could given the time I had. I'm sorry it's so buggy and I had to comment out my new hazard just to let the game run up to a point. I'm sorry neither my hazard or interactive object work properly- and they both break everything. I'm sorry I rushed you so much last minute to help me. I really appreciate it. I wish I could have given you something better than this.

But I'm really proud of what I did accomplish. I couldn't test them, but I like my level designs and think they could have been really cool. My original hazard wasn't particularly unique but I like what I did with them in the levels. My original interactive object would have been very neat if I could have gotten it to work.

I really wish I could have turned in something that showed those off, because you've always been exceptionally helpful and supportive and I wanted you to have fun and really like this. Thank you for all your help, maybe in the future this will become the game it deserves to be.
